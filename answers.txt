Q1: Why might we consider using Git? 

Answer: Git is an extremely useful version control software that allows multiple developers to work on the same project
simultaneously. It allows us to try new things with our code without being scared of it breaking (a very real fear). 
It's also the industry standard. Git is used in every SWE job, and even used in non-SWE roles fairly often. 
Getting familiar with Git as much as we can while we're students is going to be advantageous to us in the workforce.  

Q2: What field could data science be applied to? Give an Example. 

Answer: Data science can be applied to many fields, but one that sticks with me the most is Healthcare.
As someone who deals with chronic health issues daily, I love seeing how data science helps people.
